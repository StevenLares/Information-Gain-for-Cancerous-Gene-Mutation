Information Gain for Cancerous Gene Mutation

Instructions:
Information Gain.py is the only file needed for this project. Note: Login information has been censored to "REDACTED".


Project Details:
Calculated information gain for each genetic mutation in a cancer patient database by using cx_Oracle and Python to connect to an Oracle SQL server instance

Performed relational joins in embedded dynamic queries to retrieve the data and organizing it into confusion matrices using the Pandas data analysis library

Applied the information gain formula on the results. This set the foundation for a scalable prediction
system capable of estimating the likelihood of death given a cancer patientâ€™s genetic
mutations.
