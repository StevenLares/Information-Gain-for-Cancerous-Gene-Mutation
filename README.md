Information Gain for Cancerous Gene Mutation

Instructions:
Information Gain.py contains the code detailing how to retrieve data from a remote Oracle SQL database, organizing it into Pandas dataframes, and then performing the information gain procedure.

Project Details:
This project was completed during April 2018.

This project emphasized creating dynamic queries to be run from a host language.

The following responsibilities were:

Calculated information gain for each genetic mutation in a cancer patient database by using cx_Oracle and Python to connect to an Oracle SQL server instance

Performed relational joins in embedded dynamic queries to retrieve the data and organizing it into confusion matrices using the Pandas data analysis library

Applied the information gain formula on the results. This set the foundation for a scalable prediction
system capable of estimating the likelihood of death given a cancer patientâ€™s genetic
mutations.
